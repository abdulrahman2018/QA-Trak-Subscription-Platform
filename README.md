Project Name: QA Trak Subscription Platform
Technologies Used: ASP.NET Core Blazor, C#, Syncfusion Blazor Components, HTML/CSS
Role: Full-Stack Developer

 
Project Overview:
Developed a responsive subscription management platform that allows users to view and subscribe to various plans (Community, Standard, Professional, Enterprise). The application dynamically adjusts pricing for monthly and annual subscriptions, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for plan selection.
 
Key Features:
•	Dynamic Plan Selection:
Implemented four subscription plans, each with distinct features and pricing. Users can toggle between monthly and annual billing, with the interface dynamically updating to reflect the corresponding prices.
•	Interactive UI with Syncfusion Components:
Enhanced the user experience by incorporating Syncfusion Blazor components, ensuring smooth interactions and a modern interface.
•	Customizable Pricing Logic:
Designed a flexible pricing system that dynamically displays costs based on the selected billing cycle. This allows users to compare subscription costs effectively and make informed decisions.
•	Responsive Design:
Created a mobile-first layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring the platform is accessible and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.
•	State Management:
Effectively managed application states to reflect user interactions, such as selected plans and subscription status, ensuring seamless real-time updates within the UI.
 
Challenges and Solutions:
1.	Dynamic State Binding:
Managing real-time UI updates for plan selection and subscription status was complex. This challenge was overcome using Blazor’s powerful two-way data binding, which ensured that any changes in the application state were instantly reflected in the user interface.
2.	Ensuring UI Responsiveness:
Designing a responsive and user-friendly layout for different screen sizes posed a significant challenge. By applying modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, the application maintained its functionality and aesthetics across various devices.
3.	Third-Party Component Integration:
Integrating Syncfusion Blazor components seamlessly with the custom logic required careful planning. Following Syncfusion's documentation and customizing components ensured smooth functionality and alignment with project requirements.
4.	Logical Errors in Pricing Calculation:
Initially, the pricing logic faced inconsistencies, particularly with dynamically updating prices. Refactoring the logic to fetch plan details dynamically resolved this issue, resulting in accurate price displays based on the selected billing cycle.
 
Learning Outcomes:
•	Proficiency in Blazor Framework:
Gained extensive experience in Blazor’s component-based architecture and state management, which improved overall development efficiency.
•	Advanced C# Techniques:
Strengthened skills in using C# collections, LINQ queries, and asynchronous programming, contributing to more efficient backend development.
•	UI/UX Design Skills:
Enhanced understanding of responsive design principles and the integration of third-party libraries, leading to a better user experience.
•	Problem-Solving and Debugging:
Developed a structured approach to identifying, troubleshooting, and resolving both logical and UI-related issues, improving the overall robustness of the application.
 
Conclusion:
This project highlights my ability to design and implement a feature-rich .NET Blazor application, showcasing strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering an intuitive user experience. It demonstrates proficiency in both frontend and backend development, solidifying my expertise within the .NET ecosystem.
